          <h2>Project 1: Instructions</h2>
          <h3>Due: 19 March</h3>
          <h4 class="clear">Description</h4>
          <p class="clear">An important part of programming well is knowing your audience, and programs are instructions that we ask computers to do for us. In this project you will write instructions for three different target audiences: a friend, a small child, and an alien from another planet.</p>
          <h4 class="clear">Procedure</h4>
          <p>Start by choosing a multi-step task that you know very well such as tying your shoes or making a sandwich. Then, write the steps to complete that task as if you were going to tell one of your friends how to do it. Next, list the steps again with enough detail that a small child could understand it. Finally, write out the steps with an absurd amount of details, so that an alien from another planet could complete the task. For this final list you should imagine the alien you will be teaching, and write out the assumptions you have made about it (How well does it understand English? Does it have hands? How many?). You can choose to use an alien from pop culture such as Alf or the alien from Alien (though good luck teaching her how to tie shoes).</p>
          <h4>Grading</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>0 - Nothing submitted.</li>
            <li>1 - You started a list.</li>
            <li>2 - You only submitted one list.</li>
            <li>3 - Your only submitted two lists.</li>
            <li>4 - You submitted three lists, but they lack some details.</li>
            <li>5 - You submitted three well-labeled and detailed lists, as well as a description of your alien.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Submitting</h4>
          <p>Write your three lists of increasingly detailed steps in a google doc and share it with me before class on Monday. Please clearly label the audience of each set of instructions, and include the assumptions you are making about the alien.</p>

          <h2>Lab 1: Hello, World!</h2>
          <p>Get your programming environment set-up. Your choices from least to most complicated are:
            <ul>
              <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">Python Anywhere</a> Web based programming environment. There will be nothing to install and you will submit your programs as links. Also, I will be able to check in as you are working to help you if you need.

          <h2>Project 2: Computer Friend</h2>
          <h3>Due: 27 March</h3>
          <h4 class="clear">Description</h4>
          <p class="clear">In this project, you will make a program that you can talk to. The conversation doesnâ€™t need to be too long, but it should start and end (hello and good-bye), as well as ask and respond to at least two questions. The program should accept typical responses to the asked questions.</p>

          <p>Funny programs are great, but I would caution against making the program too rude as you will be running this program more than anyone else (to test it), and you do not want to get mad at your program.</p>
          <h4>Grading</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>0 - Nothing submitted or program does not run.</li>
            <li>1 - Your program runs without an error.</li>
            <li>2 - Your program starts and ends a conversation with printed messages.</li>
            <li>3 - Your program accepts user input and parrots it back.</li>
            <li>4 - Your program responds to user input, but some responses do not make sense.</li>
            <li>5 - Your program responds to typical answers to at least two questions.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Submitting</h4>
          <p>Submit your program file or PythonAnywhere link through the google form submit link before class on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Make a program that repeats everything that you type into it.</p>
          <p>Then make it repeat everything you said two sentences ago.</p>
          <h2>Lab 3: Number Speller</h2>
          <p>Make a program that spells out the name of a number when you type it. Make it work for at least the numbers 0 - 10.</p>

              This course introduces students to programming through the python programming language. Programming is a key element of working in computer science -- both studying CS in college, and in future career paths. Even students who do not intend to pursue a software engineering or technical profession will benefit from understanding how computers work and how to program.  Students who pursue technical paths will be able to learn other programming languages much easier after learning python; programming principles are the same across the most commonly used languages. Students in this class work to recognize the sort of problems that programs and computers can solve. The major topics of this course are the computational thinking skills of decomposition, data representation, abstraction, automation, and algorithms. Understanding these topics makes programming easier and more efficient, and the programs that result from this understanding run better and are more robust. Skills in these areas will also be useful for many kinds of work as professionals of all sorts rely more and more on solving problems with technology to be productive in their fields.
